      title: `The "Eat the Frog" is one of simplest yet most effective productivity techniques
around. What is the "frog" in "Eat the Frog"?`,
      comment: `The “Frog” is also known as your Most Important Task (MIT). This task is often important but not urgent, the type of
difficult task that creates a lot of mental resistance and ensuing procrastination if you don't intentionally make time for
it. You probably already know the task I’m talking about.`,
      answer: "b",
    },
    a: `An or a set of easy tasks on your "to do" list`,
    b: `Your hardest, most important task for the day`,

    question: {
      title: `When do you "eat the frog" i.e. do the most important task for the day?`,
      comment: `We all know intuitively that not all work hours are created equal. The first hour of the morning when your energy and
willpower are high is a helluva lot more productive than the hour after lunch when all you want to do is curl up and take
a nap. Eat the Frog ensures that you’re using your best hours to do your most mentally taxing work and leaves less
important tasks for times when you’ve already exhausted your brain power for the day.`,

    },
    a: `First thing in the morning`,
    b: `During an empty slot in the calendar`,

    question: {
      title: `What should be size of the task that you choose as your frog?`,
      comment: `Your frog should take half a day’s work, tops. A clearly defined, realistic task will make it easier to get started and not
procrastinate on. Checking it off your list before lunch will give you a concrete win and accompanying endorphin boost
to carry you into the rest of your day.`,
      answer: "b",
    },
    a: `A task you can complete in 30-60 mins`,
    b: `A task you can complete in 1-4 hours`,
    c: `A task you can complete in less that 30 mins`,
    d: `A task you can complete in 4-8 hours`,
  },
  {
    question: {
      title: `Why should you "eat the frog" first thing in the morning?`,
      comment: `Whatever your frog for the day happens to be, do it first thing when you sit down to work. If at all possible, don’t
schedule meetings. Don’t catch up on Twitter. Don’t check your email. Don’t even think about thinking about all the
other less important things you’ll have to do later in the day. Focus all of your mental energy on your frog and only your
frog.`,
      answer: "d",
    },
    a: `So that you can take the rest of the day off`,
    b: `So that you can eat another frog in the afternoon`,
    c: `So that you have the whole day to complete the task`,
    d: `So that your most important task gets prioritized first`,
  },
  {
    question: {
      title: `How frequently should you "eat the frog"?`,
      comment: `Any day that you eat your frog is a good day. Furthermore, following the method means you’ll be making progress on
something meaningful on a daily basis. Studies have shown that that kind of progress is a key motivator and predictor of
happiness and engagement at work, and can lead to a virtuous cycle of getting things done. We feel good when we
follow through on the things we intended to do which in turn makes it easier to continue doing them. When you
experience a win first thing in the morning, you’re more likely to build momentum and good vibes to carry you through
the rest of your workday.`,
      answer: "c",
    },
    a: `Once every week`,
    b: `Once every fortnight`,
    c: `Daily`,
    d: `Whenever you need`,

    question: {
      title: `What important habit does "eat the frog" help you develop?`,
      comment: `The most valuable work in today’s knowledge economy is almost invariably work that requires all your mental resources
to be focused on one thing — think cognitively demanding tasks like coding, designing, writing, strategizing, and
problem-solving. Yet the modern workplace isn’t set up to support that kind of distraction-free “deep work” (a phrase
coined by computer science professor Cal Newport). We’re distracted by so many emails, meetings, chat messages and
requests for input that we don’t have the time or space to focus on our highest impact tasks.
Eat The Frog requires us to push back against all of those distractions — both external (others interrupting us) and
internal (us interrupting ourselves) — and prioritize the actions that will actually bring us closer to our goals.`,

    a: `Time management`,
    b: `Multi-tasking`,
    c: `Prioritization`,
    d: `Deep work`,
